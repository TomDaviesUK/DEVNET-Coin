# DEVNET-Coin
Example Crypto Currency for Cisco Live 


This is an example currency for our CiscoLive DEVNET presentation on Blockchain technologies.  Here we create a smart contract that does the following: 

* Creates 21 million tokens we are calling ValToms. 
* Divides half of the tokens to two people: Val and Tom.
* 10,500,000 other tokens are available to buy. 
* People can send their tokens to other people. 
* If Val or Tom kill the contract, we take the coins!
* If people buy coins (which they shouldn't) they go to Val and Tom.
